Inspired by the 2023 pre-conference “HMC: Authenticity in communicating with machines,” two central questions guide the discussion: How does HMC contribute to our understanding of authentic communication with machines? And how can the concept of authenticity contribute to our sense of self as researchers within the HMC field? Through the collaborative effort of 22 authors, the paper explores the re-conceptualization of authenticity and presents recent areas of tension that guide the HMC research and community. With this paper we aim at offering a gateway for scholars to connect and engage with the evolving HMC field.},

    abstract = "Perceptions of hate can vary greatly across cultural contexts. Hate speech (HS) datasets, however, have traditionally been developed by language. This hides potential cultural biases, as one language may be spoken in different countries home to different cultures. In this work, we evaluate cultural bias in HS datasets by leveraging two interrelated cultural proxies: language and geography. We conduct a systematic survey of HS datasets in eight languages and confirm past findings on their English-language bias, but also show that this bias has been steadily decreasing in the past few years. For three geographically-widespread languages{---}English, Arabic and Spanish{---}we then leverage geographical metadata from tweets to approximate geo-cultural contexts by pairing language and country information. We find that HS datasets for these languages exhibit a strong geo-cultural bias, largely overrepresenting a handful of countries (e.g., US and UK for English) relative to their prominence in both the broader social media population and the general population speaking these languages. Based on these findings, we formulate recommendations for the creation of future HS datasets.",

abstract = {Transnational online platforms continuously navigate a mix of international and national laws, cultural norms, and political sensitivities to define what constitutes legitimate content moderation. While there is extensive research on platform governance in established democracies, less focus on the complexities of content moderation in less democratic developing countries. This integrated PhD thesis aims to contextualise how global online platforms hosting user-generated content (UGC) govern online speech within national systems that have to date been overlooked in scholarship. Sitting at the intersection of research on international political economy, platform governance, and human centred computing, the thesis draws on literature on legitimacy to offer a detailed examination of how a UGC platform originating from China (i.e., TikTok) governs online speech in two South and Southeast Asia countries - Indonesia and Pakistan. More importantly, by emphasising user insights in online speech governance, the thesis examines how users perceive the legitimacy of platformised content moderation, particularly in relation to sensitive and controversial borderline topics (i.e., gender/sexual, religious and political content). The comparative approach presents opportunities for understanding how on-the-ground insights can be mobilised to better govern algorithms and online platforms.},
