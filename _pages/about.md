I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Communication, University of Copenhagen. I completed my PhD in Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/diyi-liu/), University of Oxford.

My doctoral research examines algorithmic content moderation and the legitimacy of platformized speech governance in South and Southeast Asian contexts. It seeks to understand how on-the-ground user insights might inform policymaking around digital platforms and borderline content moderation. During my postdoc, I work on the *Power over Platforms* project where we look into non-traditional actors influencing the decision-making of consumer-facing content platforms.

My latest work has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as [Social Media + Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20563051251340855), [Policy & Internet](https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.388), [New Media & Society](https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448241259149), [Journal of Medical Internet Research](https://doi.org/10.2196/54135), and media outlets such as [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2019/09/bridging-the-gaps-in-the-asia-pacific-information-superhighway/). Previously, I interned with UNESCOâ€™s Communication and Information Unit. Starting from 2024 I have also been engaged with Meta's Actor and Behavior Policy Expert Circle. I hold visiting and fellowship positions at several institutions: a visiting PhD researcher at the Department of Communications and New Media at the National University of Singapore (Fall 2023), an Open Research Fellow at the Weizenbaum Institute in Germany (Spring 2024), and a research fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Indonesia (Fall 2024). In January 2025, I also started a Tech Policy Fellowship at the Tech Global Institute. I earned my BA and MA in International Journalism and Communication in China prior to commencing my DPhil, which is generously funded by the Clarendon Scholarship.
