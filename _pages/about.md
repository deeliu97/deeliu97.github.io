I am a PhD candidate in Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. My doctoral research examines algorithmic content moderation and the legitimacy of platformized governance over online speech in South and Southeast Asian contexts. It seeks to understand how on-the-ground user insights might inform policymaking around digital platforms and borderline content moderation.

My work has appeared in leading peer-reviewed journals such [Policy & Internet](https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.388), New Media & Society, Journal of Medical Internet Research, and media outlets such as The Diplomat. Previously, I interned with UNESCOâ€™s Communication and Information Unit, substantially contributing to pilot research applying the Internet Universality Indicators framework in Thailand, and has recently been communicating around current initiatives regarding the Guidelines for the Governance of Digital Platforms. Starting from 2024 I have also been engaged with Meta's Actor and Behavior Policy Expert Circle. Currently a DPhil candidate at the OII, I am also a visiting researcher at the National University of Singapore (Fall 2023), an open research fellow at the Weizenbaum Institute in Germany (Spring 2024), and a research fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Indonesia (Fall 2024). I earned her BA and MA in International Journalism and Communication in China prior to commencing my DPhil, which is generously funded by the Clarendon Scholarship.
