<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a PhD candidate in Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences at the <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/diyi-liu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oxford Internet Institute</a>, University of Oxford. From May 2025, I started as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Communication, University of Copenhagen.</p> <p>My doctoral research examines algorithmic content moderation and the legitimacy of platformized governance over online speech in South and Southeast Asian contexts. It seeks to understand how on-the-ground user insights might inform policymaking around digital platforms and borderline content moderation.
